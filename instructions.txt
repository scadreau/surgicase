Use functional programming primarily (Only use classes when they are needed.  Such as in models.py)
Python 3.12+
FastAPI
Go 1.24.5+

Always include the following 3 lines at the beginning of any .py or .go file (note the trailing spaces)
# Created: 
# Last Modified: 
# Author: Scott Cadreau

When needed read the most recent table_structures_<date_time>.sql file for current database and table information

The test server is https://allstarsapi1.metoraymedical.com

Always add prometheus monitoring to new endpoints

Update the main readme when appropriate

When it is deemed necessary create a separate readme with the functional details

For database integration use pymysql

At the end of a conversation, if I type "create update" please create a small .md file called in the updates directory update_<date_time>.md.  
date_time should be yyyy-MM-dd_HH-mm-ss.  
Only do this if the create update is entered on its own line.

Do not edit the # Last Modified: line.  It is handled by an automatic script on save

The aws cli user has access to all aws functionality

Do not use environment variables.  If we need to create a new variable, we will store it in AWS Secrets

Do not try to start or restart the server.  Just pause and tell me to update and reload it.

If you cannot find the schema in the current table_structures_<date_time>.sql file, run the utils/get_table_structures.py command to get the current schemas

If you install a pip package always add --break-system-packages to the command 

read the case.create_case endpoint to get a docstring format and include a verbose docstring to all new endpoints

use snake case for naming functions and variables.  Leading _ in function names is acceptable for internal functions
