Use functional programming primarily (Only use classes when they are needed.  Such as in models.py)
Python 3.12+
FastAPI
Go 1.24.5+

Always include the following 3 lines at the beginning of any .py or .go file (note the trailing spaces)
# Created: 
# Last Modified: 
# Author: Scott Cadreau

When needed read the most recent table_structures_<date_time>.sql file for current database and table information

The test server is https://allstarsapi1.metoraymedical.com

Always add prometheus monitoring to new endpoints

Update the main readme when appropriate

When it is deemed necessary create a separate readme with the functional details

For database integration use pymysql

At the end of a conversation, if I type "create report" please create a small .md file called in the updates directory update_<date_time>.md.  
date_time should be YYYY-mm-dd_hh-mm-ss.  
Only do this if the create report is entered on its own line.

Do not edit the # Last Modified: line.  It is handled by an automatic script on save
