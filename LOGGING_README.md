## Log Request Model

```python
class LogRequestModel(BaseModel):
    timestamp: datetime = Field(default_factory=datetime.now)
    user_id: str | None = None
    endpoint: str
    method: str
    request_payload: str | None = None
    query_params: str | None = None
    response_status: int
    response_payload: str | None = None
    execution_time_ms: int
    error_message: str | None = None
    client_ip: str | None = None
```

## Implementation

### Core Logging Functions

#### 1. Direct Log Request Endpoint
```python
@router.post("/log_request")
@track_business_operation("log", "request")
def log_request(log: LogRequestModel):
    # Stores log data directly to database
    # Used for external logging requests
```

#### 2. Utility Function for Endpoints
```python
def log_request_from_endpoint(
    request: Request, 
    execution_time_ms: int, 
    response_status: int, 
    user_id: str = None, 
    response_data: dict = None, 
    error_message: str = None
):
    # Automated logging for any endpoint
    # Extracts data from FastAPI Request object
    # Handles client IP detection from multiple sources
```

### Integration Pattern

All monitored endpoints follow this pattern:

```python
@router.method("/endpoint")
@track_business_operation("operation", "entity")
def endpoint_function(request: Request, ...):
    conn = None
    start_time = time.time()
    response_status = 200
    response_data = None
    error_message = None
    
    try:
        # Main endpoint logic
        response_data = {"result": "success"}
        return response_data
        
    except HTTPException as http_error:
        response_status = http_error.status_code
        error_message = str(http_error.detail)
        raise
    except Exception as e:
        response_status = 500
        error_message = str(e)
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail={"error": str(e)})
        
    finally:
        execution_time_ms = int((time.time() - start_time) * 1000)
        
        from endpoints.utility.log_request import log_request_from_endpoint
        log_request_from_endpoint(
            request=request,
            execution_time_ms=execution_time_ms,
            response_status=response_status,
            user_id=user_id,
            response_data=response_data,
            error_message=error_message
        )
```

## Data Storage

### Database Schema
Logs are stored in the `request_logs` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE request_logs (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    timestamp DATETIME,
    user_id VARCHAR(255),
    endpoint VARCHAR(255),
    method VARCHAR(10),
    request_payload TEXT,
    query_params TEXT,
    response_status INT,
    response_payload TEXT,
    execution_time_ms INT,
    error_message TEXT,
    client_ip VARCHAR(45),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Data Retention
- **Production**: Logs retained for compliance requirements
- **Development**: Configurable retention periods
- **Archive**: Automated cleanup processes available

## Client IP Detection

The system automatically detects client IP addresses from multiple sources:

1. **Direct Connection**: `request.client.host`
2. **Load Balancer**: `X-Forwarded-For` header
3. **Proxy**: `X-Real-IP` header
4. **Fallback**: Connection metadata

## Performance Monitoring

### Metrics Tracked
- **Execution Time**: Precise millisecond timing
- **Response Sizes**: Payload size monitoring
- **Error Rates**: Success/failure ratios
- **Usage Patterns**: Endpoint frequency analysis

### Integration with Monitoring Stack
- **Prometheus**: Metrics collection and alerting
- **Business Metrics**: Custom business operation tracking
- **Structured Logging**: JSON-formatted log entries

## Error Handling

### Fault Tolerance
- **Non-Blocking**: Logging failures don't affect main operations
- **Graceful Degradation**: Operations continue if logging fails
- **Error Isolation**: Logging errors are captured separately

### Error Categories
- **Validation Errors**: Input parameter validation failures
- **Permission Errors**: Authorization and access control violations
- **Database Errors**: Connection and query failures
- **Business Logic Errors**: Application-specific error conditions

## Security Considerations

### Data Privacy
- **Sensitive Data**: Automatic sanitization of sensitive information
- **PII Protection**: Configurable masking of personal data
- **Payload Filtering**: Optional request/response payload redaction

### Access Control
- **Admin Access**: Restricted access to log data
- **Audit Logs**: Tracking of log access and modifications
- **Encryption**: Database-level encryption for sensitive logs

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Database logging
LOG_DATABASE_ENABLED=true
