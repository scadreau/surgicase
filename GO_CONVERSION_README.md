# Go Conversion Strategy for SurgiCase API

## Overview

This document outlines the strategy for converting performance-critical Python functions to Go while maintaining system reliability through a hybrid architecture with automatic failover capabilities.

## **Top Priority Functions for Go Conversion**

## **API Gateway Modifications Required**

### **1. Service Discovery & Routing**

```yaml
# Example routing configuration
services:
  bulk-operations-go:
    health_check: /health
    fallback: bulk-operations-python
    timeout: 30s
    endpoints:
      - /bulkupdatecasestatus
      - /npi/load
      - /utils/pay-amount-calculator
  
  exports-go:
    health_check: /health  
    fallback: exports-python
    timeout: 60s
    endpoints:
      - /export/quickbooks
      - /reports/provider-payment
  
  case-operations-go:
    health_check: /health
    fallback: case-operations-python
    timeout: 15s
    endpoints:
      - /casefilter
      - /casesbystatus
```

### **2. Health Check & Failover Logic**

#### Circuit Breaker Pattern
- **Failure threshold**: 3 consecutive failures
- **Timeout period**: 5 seconds per request
- **Recovery time**: 30 seconds before retry
- **Health check interval**: 10 seconds

#### Implementation Strategy
```yaml
failover:
  strategy: "circuit_breaker"
  timeout: 5s
  max_failures: 3
  recovery_time: 30s
  health_check_path: "/health"
  
routing:
  primary_backend: "go-service"
  fallback_backend: "python-service"
  load_balancing: "round_robin"
```

### **3. Request Routing Strategy**

#### Priority Routing
1. **Primary**: Route to Go service first
2. **Health Check**: Verify Go service availability
3. **Fallback**: Redirect to Python if Go fails
4. **Monitoring**: Log all failover events

#### Load Balancing
- **Go services**: Handle bulk operations and exports
- **Python services**: Handle CRUD operations and legacy functions
- **Hybrid routing**: Route based on endpoint performance characteristics

## **Failover Architecture Implementation**

### **1. Gateway Configuration**

```yaml
# API Gateway failover configuration
version: "1.0"
name: "surgicase-hybrid-gateway"

upstream_services:
  go_services:
    - name: "bulk-operations"
      url: "http://go-bulk:8080"
      health_check: "/health"
    - name: "exports"
      url: "http://go-exports:8080" 
      health_check: "/health"
  
  python_services:
    - name: "main-api"
      url: "http://python-api:8000"
      health_check: "/health"

routing_rules:
  - path: "/bulkupdatecasestatus"
    primary: "go_services.bulk-operations"
    fallback: "python_services.main-api"
  
  - path: "/export/*"
    primary: "go_services.exports"
    fallback: "python_services.main-api"
```

### **2. Implementation Phases**

### **3. Testing Strategy**
