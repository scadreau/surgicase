    Search for healthcare facilities by name using optimized A-Z search tables.
    
    This function implements an intelligent search strategy across alphabetized search tables
    for optimal performance when searching through millions of NPI facility records:
    
    SEARCH STRATEGY:
    1. Determines the appropriate search table based on the first letter of facility_name
    2. Uses the optimized search_facility_[a-z] table for that letter
    3. Performs LIKE search on facility_name for partial matching
    4. Leverages database indexes for fast query execution
    
    TABLE STRUCTURE:
    - Tables: search_surgeon_facility.search_facility_a through search_facility_z
    - Indexes: idx_npi, idx_facility_name
    - Data source: npi_data_2 (Organization providers from NPI registry)
    
    PERFORMANCE BENEFITS:
    - Distributes millions of records across 26 smaller tables (~20K-100K records each)
    - Eliminates need to scan entire dataset for each search
    - Uses targeted indexes for facility name searches
    - Typical query time: <50ms vs >3000ms for full table scan
    
    FIELD FORMATTING:
    - Applies proper capitalization to facility names and addresses
    - Handles state abbreviations (2-char) vs full state names
    - Normalizes hospital/clinic names for consistent presentation
    - Formats medical facility addresses appropriately
    
    FACILITY TYPES COVERED:
    - Hospitals and medical centers
    - Clinics and urgent care facilities
    - Surgical centers and specialty practices
    - Laboratories and diagnostic centers
    - Pharmacies and medical equipment suppliers
    
    Args:
        facility_name (str): Healthcare facility name (partial matching supported)
        
    Returns:
        dict: JSON response with matching facilities, search criteria, and result count
        
    Raises:
        HTTPException: 400 if facility_name parameter is missing/empty
        HTTPException: 500 if database error occurs
