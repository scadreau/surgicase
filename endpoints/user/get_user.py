    Retrieve comprehensive user profile information including personal details and associated documents.
    
    This endpoint fetches complete user profile data from the user_profile table along with all
    associated documents from the user_documents table. Only active users are returned,
    ensuring soft-deleted users are properly excluded from system access.
    
    Key Features:
    - Complete user profile retrieval with validation
    - Associated document metadata inclusion
    - Active user filtering (soft-delete protection)
    - Comprehensive error handling and monitoring
    - Professional information access (NPI, licensing, etc.)
    - Contact and address information retrieval
    - User type and preference information
    
    Args:
        request (Request): FastAPI request object for logging and monitoring
        user_id (str): Unique identifier of the user to retrieve (required query parameter)
    
    Returns:
        dict: Response containing:
            - user (dict): Complete user profile object with:
                - user_id (str): Unique user identifier
                - user_email (str): User's email address
                - first_name (str): User's first name
                - last_name (str): User's last name
                - addr1 (str): Primary address line
                - addr2 (str): Secondary address line
                - city (str): City of residence
                - state (str): State/province of residence
                - zipcode (str): Postal/ZIP code

                    - document_type (str): Type/category of document
                    - document_name (str): Name/path of the document file
            - user_id (str): The user ID that was requested (for convenience)
    
    Raises:
        HTTPException:
            - 400 Bad Request: Missing user_id parameter
            - 404 Not Found: User does not exist or is inactive (soft-deleted)
            - 500 Internal Server Error: Database connection or query errors
    
    Database Operations:
        1. Validates user_id parameter presence
        2. Queries user_profile table for active user data
        3. Fetches associated documents from user_documents table
        4. Combines profile and document data into unified response
        5. Ensures only active users (active=1) are accessible
    
    Active User Filtering:
        - Only users with active=1 status are returned
        - Soft-deleted users (active=0) return 404 Not Found
        - This ensures deactivated users cannot access the system
        - Maintains data integrity while preserving audit trails
    
    Document Integration:
        - Fetches all documents associated with the user
        - Documents include type classification and file references
        - Empty documents array returned if no documents exist
        - Document metadata only (actual files stored separately)
    
    Professional Information:
        - NPI (National Provider Identifier) for healthcare professionals
        - State licensing information for regulatory compliance
        - User type classification for role-based access control
        - Referral chain information for business relationships
    
    Monitoring & Logging:
        - Business metrics tracking for user read operations
        - Prometheus monitoring via @track_business_operation decorator
        - Execution time tracking and detailed response logging
        - Error categorization for different failure types:
            * not_found: User doesn't exist or is inactive
            * success: User data retrieved successfully
            * error: General database or connection errors
    
    Security Features:
        - Only active users can be retrieved
        - Soft-deleted users properly excluded
        - All database queries use parameterized statements
        - No sensitive authentication data included in response
    
    Performance Optimizations:
        - Single database connection for all operations
        - Efficient JOIN-like operations with separate queries
        - Proper connection management with automatic cleanup
        - Minimal database round trips
    
    Data Integrity:
        - Consistent user data retrieval
        - Document associations properly maintained
        - Active status validation prevents access to deactivated accounts
        - Transactional data consistency

        - Timezone information affects user experience but not core functionality
        - Communication preferences control system notification behavior
