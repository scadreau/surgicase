    Search for surgeons by name using optimized A-Z partitioned search tables.
    
    This endpoint provides intelligent surgeon search functionality across the national NPI registry including:
    - High-performance search across millions of individual provider records
    - Optimized A-Z table partitioning for sub-100ms query times
    - Dual-field name matching with intelligent text formatting
    - Comprehensive monitoring and business metrics tracking
    - Full request logging and execution time tracking
    - Prometheus metrics integration for operational monitoring
    
    Search Strategy & Performance:
        - Determines appropriate search table based on first letter of last_name
        - Uses optimized search_surgeon_[a-z] tables (26 partitions)
        - Distributes millions of records across smaller indexed tables (~50K-200K each)
        - Leverages composite indexes (idx_last_first, idx_last_name, idx_first_name)
        - Performs dual LIKE searches on both first_name and last_name with wildcards
        - Typical query time: <100ms vs >5000ms for full table scan
        - Eliminates need to scan entire NPI dataset for each search
    
    Table Structure & Data Source:
        - Tables: search_surgeon_facility.search_surgeon_a through search_surgeon_z
        - Primary indexes: idx_npi (unique), idx_last_name, idx_first_name, idx_last_first (composite)
        - Data source: npi_data_1 (Individual providers from National NPI registry)
        - Record types: Physicians, surgeons, specialists, and other individual healthcare providers
    
    Text Formatting & Normalization:
        - Applies proper capitalization to names via capitalize_name_field()
        - Normalizes city names with appropriate capitalization
        - Handles state abbreviations (2-char) vs full state names
        - Formats medical provider addresses appropriately
        - Ensures consistent presentation across all search results
        - Converts search terms to uppercase for database matching
    
    Provider Types Covered:
        - Surgeons and surgical specialists
        - Physicians and medical doctors
        - Specialists (cardiologists, orthopedic surgeons, etc.)
        - Residents and fellows in training
        - Other individual healthcare providers with NPI numbers
    
    Args:
        request (Request): FastAPI request object for logging and monitoring
        first_name (str): Surgeon's first name to search for (partial matching supported)
        last_name (str): Surgeon's last name to search for (partial matching supported)
        user_id (str, optional): User ID for enhanced logging and monitoring
    
    Returns:
        dict: Response containing:
            - statusCode (int): HTTP status code (200 for successful search)
            - body (dict): Response data including:
                - message (str): Search result summary with count
                - search_criteria (dict): Echo of search parameters used
                - surgeons (List[dict]): Array of matching surgeons, each containing:
                    - npi (str): National Provider Identifier
                    - first_name (str): Formatted first name
                    - last_name (str): Formatted last name
                    - address (str): Formatted street address
                    - city (str): Formatted city name
                    - state (str): State abbreviation or full name
                    - zip (str): ZIP/postal code
    
    Raises:
        HTTPException: 
            - 400 Bad Request: first_name or last_name parameters are missing or empty
            - 500 Internal Server Error: Database query failures or connection issues
    
    Database Operations:
        - Determines target table based on first letter of last_name
        - Executes parameterized dual LIKE query with wildcard matching
        - Converts search terms to uppercase for consistent matching
        - Applies text formatting to all returned surgeon data
        - Uses proper cursor management and connection cleanup
    
    Monitoring & Logging:
        - Business metrics tracking for surgeon search operations
        - Prometheus monitoring via @track_business_operation decorator
        - Records success/error metrics via business_metrics.record_surgeon_operation()
        - Comprehensive request logging with execution time tracking
        - Error logging with full exception details
    
    Input Validation:
        - Validates both first_name and last_name are not empty or whitespace-only
        - Handles non-alphabetic first characters in last_name (defaults to 'a' table)
        - Strips whitespace from search terms before processing
        - Returns appropriate 400 error for invalid input
    
    Example:
        GET /search-surgeon?first_name=John&last_name=Smith&user_id=user123
        
        Response:
        {

                    "last_name": "Smith",
                    "user_id": "user123"
                },
                "surgeons": [
                    {
                        "npi": "1234567890",
                        "first_name": "John",
                        "last_name": "Smith",

                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    
    Note:
        - Search is case-insensitive and supports partial matching on both names
        - Results are automatically formatted for consistent presentation
        - Non-alphabetic last_name characters default to 'a' table for processing
        - Search covers only individual provider NPI records (not organizations)
        - Facility searches should use facility search endpoints
        - Both first_name and last_name are required parameters
