    - Unified dashboard combining health, case, and user analytics
    - Intelligent error isolation preventing total failure from partial issues
    - Real-time system health monitoring integration
    - Case analytics with optional date filtering for temporal analysis
    - User distribution insights across organizational structure
    - Administrative access control with comprehensive permission validation
    - Graceful degradation with partial data availability
